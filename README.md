# Filter-Duplicate-Images
This repository contains a Python script designed to detect and handle duplicate images in a given directory. The script supports JPEG and JPG formats, identifies duplicate images using perceptual hashing, and organizes the results by moving erroneous files to a designated error folder and saving unique images to a specified output folder.
